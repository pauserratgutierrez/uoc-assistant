# Discord Bot
The ShardingManager (shard.js)
Responsibility: Process orchestration, scaling, lifecycle management
Purpose: Creates, monitors, and manages bot instances (shards)
Location: Entry point of your application
Focus: Infrastructure concerns (scaling, IPC, monitoring)

The Bot Client (app.js)
Responsibility: Discord API interactions, event handling, commands
Purpose: Implements the actual bot functionality
Location: Loaded by the ShardingManager
Focus: Application logic (responding to messages, handling commands)

Benefits of This Separation
- Scalability
The ShardingManager can dynamically adjust the number of shards
Each shard handles a subset of guilds for better performance
- Fault Tolerance
If one shard crashes, others continue running
The manager can automatically restart failed shards
- Resource Management
Memory usage is distributed across multiple processes
CPU-intensive tasks don't block the entire bot
- Maintainability
Easier to update bot functionality without changing shard management
Cleaner code with single-responsibility principle

Technical Explanation
If a bot grows beyond ~2500 guilds, Discord requires sharding. The ShardingManager:
- Creates separate Node.js processes (one per shard)
- Each process runs its own instance of your bot code (app.js)
- Each shard is responsible for a subset of guilds
- The manager handles inter-process communication
